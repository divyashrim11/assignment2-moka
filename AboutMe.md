# Divya Shree Moka

This is Divya Shree Moka. I would like to spend more time with myself. I read novels, sing songs and make reels when I get free time. I read more self-help books. "Atomic Habits" by James Clear is my favourite book. The last book I've read while I'm in India is "It ends with us" by Colleen Hoover.
